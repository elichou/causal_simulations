# Causal Simulations Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, and environments dedicated to conducting causal simulations. The centerpiece of this collection is the `CausalSimulationsNotebook.ipynb`, which integrates agents and environments to run a series of five distinct simulation sets.

## Files Description

### Jupyter Notebooks

- `CausalSimulationsNotebook.ipynb`: This is the main notebook that orchestrates the causal simulations. It includes sections for:
  - **Agents**: Code and documentation for the agents participating in the simulations.
  - **Environments**: Setup and configuration for the environments where the simulations are executed.
  - **Simulations**: A series of five simulation sets, each designed to test and analyze different aspects of agent behavior and causality.


### Python Scripts

- `bandit_game_psychopy`: Python script that possibly relates to a psychophysics experiment or a bandit-style game setup for the agents.

- `causal_simulations`: Python scripts containing the core functions and classes required for running the causal simulations.

- `causalbanditenv`: A Python script likely involving an environment setup for bandit-based causal simulations.

### Environments and Tests

- `tests`: A directory containing test scripts and configurations to ensure the reliability and correctness of the simulation code.

### Miscellaneous


- `notebook_images`: Directory that  contains images used in the notebooks.


### Setup Files

- `README.rst`: Used for documentation purposes.

- `pyproject.toml`: Configuration file to manage the build system requirements for Python projects.

## Getting Started

To run the simulations:

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` (you will need to create this requirements file based on the libraries used in the notebooks).
2. Open the `CausalSimulationsNotebook.ipynb` with Jupyter Lab/Notebook and follow the instructions within.
